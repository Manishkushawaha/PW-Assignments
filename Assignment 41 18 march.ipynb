    "Ans: The Filter method in feature selection is a technique that ranks features based on their statistical characteristics, without considering the specific machine learning algorithm. It involves calculating a score for each feature, such as correlation or mutual information, and then selecting the top-ranked features based on a threshold. It is simple and efficient but does not consider feature interdependencies or algorithm-specific relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Feature Scoring: The first step in the Filter method is to calculate a score for each feature in the dataset. This score reflects the relevance of the feature to the target variable, independent of any learning algorithm. Various statistical metrics can be used to calculate this score, such as correlation, chi-square, information gain, or mutual information.\n",
    "\n",
    " .Correlation: Measures the linear relationship between a feature and the target variable. It is commonly used for continuous     target variables. Positive correlation indicates that the feature and the target variable increase or decrease together, while   negative correlation indicates an inverse relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    " .Chi-square: Evaluates the dependence between two categorical variables. It is useful when the target variable is categorical.Information gain: Measures the reduction in entropy (uncertainty) of the target variable after considering the feature. It is   commonly used for decision tree-based algorithms and categorical features.\n",
    "\n",
    " .Mutual information: Quantifies the amount of information that can be obtained about the target variable by knowing the feature.It can handle both categorical and continuous features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Feature Ranking: Once the scores are calculated for all features, they are sorted in descending order. The higher the score, the more relevant the feature is considered to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Feature Selection: After ranking the features, a threshold is set to determine the number of features to be selected. The threshold can be a fixed number or a percentage of the total number of features. The top-ranked features up to the threshold are selected as the final subset of features."

    "Ans: Some common techniques used in Embedded feature selection methods include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator): It applies a penalty to the linear regression model's coefficients, forcing some of them to become zero. Features with non-zero coefficients are selected as the most relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Ridge Regression: Similar to LASSO, Ridge Regression adds a penalty term to the linear regression model, but it uses the L2 norm instead of the L1 norm. This technique helps reduce the impact of irrelevant features and select the most informative ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Elastic Net: It combines the L1 and L2 penalties of LASSO and Ridge Regression, respectively. Elastic Net encourages sparsity in feature selection while also handling correlated features more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Decision Trees: Decision tree-based algorithms, such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, can evaluate feature importance based on their contribution to splitting nodes and reducing impurity. Features with higher importance scores are considered more relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Regularized Linear Models: Techniques like Logistic Regression with L1 or L2 regularization (e.g., L1 Logistic Regression or Ridge Logistic Regression) can effectively perform feature selection by shrinking or eliminating the coefficients of less relevant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Support Vector Machines (SVM): SVM-based methods, such as Linear SVM with L1 regularization or the Linear SVM with Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE), can identify the most informative features by optimizing the separating hyperplane or recursively eliminating less relevant features."
