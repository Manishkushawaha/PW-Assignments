    "\n",
    "Ans:A compiled language is converted into machine code so that the processor can execute it. An interpreted language is a language in which the implementations execute instructions directly without earlier compiling a program into machine language. The compiled programs run faster than interpreted programs."

    "\n",
    "Ans: Python is an interpreted language, which means the source code of a Python program is converted into bytecode that is then executed by the Python virtual machine. Python is different from major compiled languages, such as C and C + +, as Python code is not required to be built and linked like code for these languages."
