    "Ans:Elastic Net Regression is a regression technique that combines both L1 and L2 regularization methods to overcome the limitations of each. It is particularly useful when dealing with datasets that have a large number of features or when there is multicollinearity among the predictor variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Elastic Net Regression, the objective function is a combination of the L1 norm (Lasso regularization) and the L2 norm (Ridge regularization). This results in a penalty term that encourages both sparsity (shrinking some coefficients to exactly zero) and grouping effect (encouraging highly correlated variables to have similar coefficients). The combination of L1 and L2 regularization in Elastic Net Regression allows it to select important features while handling correlated predictors more effectively than either Lasso or Ridge regression alone."

The ratio parameter determines the balance between L1 and L2 regularization. A ratio of 0 corresponds to Ridge regression, while a ratio of 1 corresponds to Lasso regression.\n",

By evaluating the performance of the model on different combinations of parameter values using a validation set, you can select the values that provide the best trade-off between bias and variance."

    "Ans: In Elastic Net Regression, the coefficients can be interpreted similarly to those in linear regression. The magnitude of a coefficient represents the strength of the relationship between the corresponding predictor variable and the target variable. Positive coefficients indicate a positive association, while negative coefficients indicate a negative association.\n",

    "However, due to the grouping effect in Elastic Net Regression, interpreting individual coefficients can be more challenging. When highly correlated predictors are present, the coefficients may be distributed among the correlated variables, making it difficult to attribute the effect to a specific variable alone. Therefore, it is important to consider the groupings and overall patterns of coefficients when interpreting the results."
