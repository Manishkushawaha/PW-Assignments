    "Descriptive statistics deals with the collection, presentation, and description of data. It summarizes and organizes the data into meaningful patterns and statistics, such as averages, standard deviations, and frequencies. Descriptive statistics are useful when you need to understand and summarize data to make sense of it or communicate it to others.\n",

It involves hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis, among others. Inferential statistics are useful when you need to make predictions or inferences about a population based on a smaller sample.\n",

    "For example, a public health agency might use inferential statistics to determine whether a new drug is effective in treating a disease by conducting a randomized controlled trial with a sample of patients, and then using statistical techniques to determine whether the results can be generalized to the larger population of patients with the disease.\n"

It is primarily concerned with describing the basic features of a dataset, such as the mean, median, mode, range, variance, and standard deviation. Descriptive statistics are used to summarize and describe the characteristics of a sample or population, and can be used to make comparisons between groups or variables.\n",
