    "Ans:The Cumulative Density Function (CDF) is a function used to describe the probability distribution of a random variable. It gives the probability that the random variable takes on a value less than or equal to a certain value. The CDF is denoted by F(x), where x is the value of the random variable.\n",

If we have two random variables X and Y, we can compare their CDFs to see which one is more likely to take on larger or smaller values. We can also use the CDF to calculate the probability of X being greater than or equal to Y, or vice versa.\n",
