    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the practice of hiding implementation details of an object from the outside world and providing access to it only through a well-defined interface. This allows for better organization and abstraction of code and helps to prevent unwanted modifications to the object's internal state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class to be based on an existing class, inheriting its attributes and methods. This allows for code reuse and helps to create a hierarchical class structure where more specialized classes can be derived from more general ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism means the ability of objects to take on many forms. In OOP, polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they were objects of the same class. This can be achieved through method overriding and method overloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction is the practice of representing essential features of an object without including unnecessary details. This allows for a high-level view of the object and helps to reduce complexity and increase efficiency in code. Abstraction can be achieved through interfaces and abstract classes."
