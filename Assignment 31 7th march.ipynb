    "Ans: Range is the simplest measure of dispersion and is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset. It gives an idea of the spread of the data points but is highly sensitive to outliers. For example, if we have a dataset of exam scores for a class of 20 students, with the highest score being 95 and the lowest score being 45, the range would be 50 (95 - 45). This tells us that there is a 50-point difference between the highest and lowest scores in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance is the average of the squared differences of each data point from the mean of the dataset. It gives an idea of how spread out the data points are relative to the mean. A higher variance indicates a greater spread of the data points, while a lower variance indicates that the data points are tightly clustered around the mean. For example, if we have a dataset of monthly temperatures for a city over a year, with a mean temperature of 20 degrees Celsius and a variance of 4, this tells us that the temperatures vary by an average of 4 degrees Celsius from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard deviation is the square root of the variance and is one of the most commonly used measures of dispersion. It gives an idea of the typical distance of the data points from the mean. A higher standard deviation indicates that the data points are more spread out from the mean, while a lower standard deviation indicates that the data points are more tightly clustered around the mean. For example, if we have a dataset of employee salaries in a company, with a mean salary of $50,000 and a standard deviation of $10,000, this tells us that most employees have salaries within $10,000 of the mean, and only a few employees have salaries that are significantly higher or lower."
